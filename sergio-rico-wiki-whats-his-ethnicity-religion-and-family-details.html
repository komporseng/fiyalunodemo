<time>27 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><strong>Learn more about PSG goalkeeper Sergio Rico’s religion, family history, and ethnicity in the sections below</strong>. Sergio Rico, a Spanish professional football player, was hospitalized on May 28 after a horseback riding accident. The young player had a head injury and was being treated in an intensive care unit.</p><p>Rico was riding his horse to Huelva, near his native city of Seville in Spain, when he was thrown off. According to eyewitnesses, once Rico struck the ground, a horse kicked him many times in the head. Rico was flown by helicopter to Seville’s Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, where his status was updated. According to current sources, the PSG goalkeeper’s health is steady. He is, however, still in the intensive care unit. In addition, his health is being closely watched by medical personnel.</p><h2>Sergio Rico of PSG Religion: Is He a Christian?</h2><p><strong>Sergio Rico</strong> has not revealed anything about his religion or beliefs. As a result, there is little information available regarding the professional footballer’s faith and religious views. Rico is one of the well-known athletes who have chosen to keep their personal lives and religious beliefs out of the spotlight.&nbsp;Many celebrities have received hostility after discussing their beliefs and religion. Furthermore, religious views are personal and may vary greatly amongst persons. As a result, Sergio must decide whether or not to mention it publicly. Sergio Rico, regardless of his religious convictions, is a world-class football goalie. Several feats, incredible renown, and success have distinguished his decade-long career.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sergio-Rico-1.jpg alt="Sergio Rico" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The PSG goalkeeper began his professional career at Sevilla, where he appeared in 170 competitive games. The excellent player and his squad won the Europa League twice during his stint there. The Spanish athlete joined Paris Saint-Germain on a temporary loan in 2019. In 2020, he signed a long-term contract with the club. Rico made his senior debut for Spain in 2016 and was included in the European Championship squad. Nonetheless, his career has been spectacular so far.</p><h2>Sergio Rico’s Ethnicity And Family</h2><p><strong>Sergio Rico</strong> was born in Seville, Andalusia, Spain on September 1, 1993. Rico, as previously said, wants to keep his personal life out of the public. As a result, nothing is known about his parents, family, and past.&nbsp;When it comes to his origins and roots, the Paris Saint-Germain official is of Spanish descent. Because neither his parents nor his ancestors’ origins are known, it is unknown whether he has any other ancestors. Rico is also from Seville, Spain. As a result, his parents and relatives may live in the same city. Despite the fact that the professional player has not revealed much about his family, he must have a close relationship with them.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sergio-Rico-2.jpg alt="Sergio Rico" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The PSG star seems to use every opportunity to visit his country and spend time with his family. Rico traveled to Spain after the squad was granted a week off.&nbsp;Unfortunately, a catastrophe occurred when he was horseback riding, and he sustained serious injuries. Thankfully, the most recent update verified that the player is in good health. However, he is still in the critical care unit.&nbsp;Sergio Rico’s wife, Alba Silva, posted a worrisome comment on Instagram on Thursday. “Do not leave me alone, my love, because I swear I can’t and don’t know how to live without you,” she wrote. We adore you tremendously.”&nbsp;We wish the PSG goalkeeper a quick recovery.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqnqqXnrxuvsicpmavmaC2bsPHmqusZZiewG6x06GlopuZqcZuvsSloKChn6N6orrDZp2apZmhxm6wxK2YoqSjZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsergio-rico-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-religion-and-family-details.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsergio-rico-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-religion-and-family-details.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsergio-rico-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-religion-and-family-details.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsergio-rico-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-religion-and-family-details.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsergio-rico-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-religion-and-family-details.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsergio-rico-wiki-whats-his-ethnicity-religion-and-family-details.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./cara-delevingne-friends-reunion-rachel-bridesmaid-dress-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./cara-delevingne-friends-reunion-rachel-bridesmaid-dress-photos.html>Wears Rachels Bridemaid Dress Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./leaky-black-height-in-feet-how-tall-is-he.html>Leaky Black Height In Feet -How Tall Is He?
