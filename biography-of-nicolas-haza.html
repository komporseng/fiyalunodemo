His parents are the renowned actress Ludwicka Paleta and Plutarco de la Haza. As for his family life we must point out that he has been considered as a very affectionate older brother, since he maintains a very good relationship with the children that his parents have had with their respective partners, since they are currently separated.</p><p>On his mother’s side, Ludwika Paleta,<strong>&nbsp;Nicolás&nbsp;Haza&nbsp;has Barbara and Sebastian as siblings</strong>, whom his mother had as a result of her relationship with Emiliano Salinas. While on his father’s side, Plutarco Haza has as a&nbsp;<strong>half-brother little Leonardo</strong>, who was born in 2019 as a result of&nbsp;Plutarco Haza’s&nbsp;relationship with Ximena del Toro.&nbsp;At this point it is important to mention that Nicolás Haza is especially close to his mother, next to whom he shares a lot of content on his Instagram social network account.</p><p>From an early age, partly due to the influence of his mother,&nbsp;<strong>Nicolás&nbsp;Haza&nbsp;</strong>was interested in the world of entertainment, so he moved to Canada, where he studied a career in cinematography in Toronto.</p><p>However, shortly after he realized that his true passion was music, so it is considered that the beginnings of his artistic career occurred in 2021, when&nbsp;<strong>Nicolás Haza launched his first known single&nbsp;</strong>under the name of “Trenze”, which was followed by the musical themes of: “No te dolió”, “Flying high”, “Navagando”, “Odisea” and “Vuelta al mundo”; although at first Nicolás Haza&nbsp;<strong>became known within music as Nico Haza&nbsp;</strong>but then finally decided to call himself<strong>&nbsp;“Niico”.</strong></p><p>Regarding the beginnings of his artistic career, in different interviews&nbsp;<strong>Nicolás&nbsp;Haza&nbsp;</strong>has commented on how he knew he wanted to&nbsp;<strong>dedicate himself to music within the genre of trap and hip hop</strong>:&nbsp;“Since I was little I started playing the guitar, I have always been involved in music, as much as cinema, I studied cinema but music never left my life, It was always there, so it’s my way of integrating music and doing what I like.”</p><h2>Trajectory and history of Nicolás Haza</h2><p>In the artistic career of&nbsp;<strong>Nicolás Haza</strong>, being our knowledge that for him, success as a singer does not seek him in international fame, but in the satisfaction of living from music: “I would not want to hit in a&nbsp;global way tomorrow and say: “what a, but I did not enjoy the process.” I think personal growth is one of the most fun things there can be.”</p><p><strong>Nicolás Haza&nbsp;</strong>said he was happy because his parents respect his decisions and support him on the way to fulfill his dreams, this is how in his own words he has said that:&nbsp;“They support me in everything I do. They give me my space to grow creatively and personally, so I thank them very much for that, besides I think that with them knowing that it is something that makes me happy and I am expressing myself with the world, they support me.”</p><p>At the beginning of 2021,&nbsp;<strong>Niico musical stage name of Nicolás Haza</strong>&nbsp;released the song “Odisea” but did not have very good results because after several weeks he had only registered more than 50 thousand views; this song was added to his previous musical releases such as the songs “Flying High” and “Tranze“. As if that were not enough, he celebrated being the cover of the magazine EstiloDF where he appeared with Patricio Gallardo,&nbsp;<strong>Nicolás Haza</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Carlos Said&nbsp;as the great promises of television.</p><p><span>With a career full of many successes in novels and series, in February 2022 the remake of the successful 1979 novel “Los ricos también lloran” was released as part of the Fábrica de sueños franchise in which Televisa was returning to make the most classic novelas in its history. In the series-novel “Los ricos también lloran” 2022, the actor&nbsp;<strong>Nicolás Haza played Luis Alberto Salvatierra in his young stage</strong>, having one of the key characters of this melodrama that also had other great figures of acting such as;&nbsp;Sabrina Seara,&nbsp;Alexa Díaz Ordaz,&nbsp;Flor Martino,&nbsp;Ian Monterrubio,&nbsp;León Peraza,&nbsp;Natasha Domínguez, among others.</span></p><h2>Girlfriends of Nicolás Haza</h2><p class=p1>With regard to the love life of the young singer N<strong>icolás Haza, it is our knowledge that he maintains a dating relationship with Yulianna de Souza, with</strong>&nbsp;whom he has been dating since April of this year 2021.</p><p class=p1>However, Yulianna de Souza has not been the only woman in her life, since when she was 17 years old she was romantically linked with one of the daughters of the famous comedian&nbsp;Adal Ramones, named Paola, although at the time the news was a success among the entertainment press, later, without knowing for sure the reason, The bride and groom lost track.</p><h2>Nicolas Haza Pack</h2><p>Although in social networks and on the internet people look a lot for the pack of Nicolás Haza or photos in which you can see with little clothes or in sensual poses, the truth is that at present there is no pack of Nicolás Haza more than those photos that the artist has published in his own networks and that could be considered sexy.</p><h2>How much is the fortune of Nicolás Haza?</h2><p>This is one of the questions that people ask most about Nicolás Haza and although they always end up answering it on other pages with a “I don’t know” or “it depends” if there are some estimates that several web portals mention. However, it is not possible to make an exact calculation about the fortune of this great star that is Nicolás Haza within the middle of the show, even so more than being interested in the fortune of a person the important thing is the talent he has and that I have made him within the great figures of the international entertainment medium.</p><p>No doubt the career of this great star Nicolás Haza will continue to rise and we will be attentive to everything that happens around him, so we invite you not to take off from our page for the next updates we will have in the&nbsp;<strong>life, trajectory, history and biography of Nicolás Haza.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiqnqN7r7OOm6Con6KWvanFjKidZqaZmLytrdJmn5qykWQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbiography-of-nicolas-haza.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbiography-of-nicolas-haza.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbiography-of-nicolas-haza.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbiography-of-nicolas-haza.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbiography-of-nicolas-haza.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbiography-of-nicolas-haza.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kerri-snead-death.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kerri-snead-death.html>Kerri Snead Death: What Happened To Her?
