<time>27 Jun 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>It requires a great deal of talent and charisma to play as a layered and thoughtful character as Lenny Bruce in the award-winning period comedy-drama TV The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. And there could not be a better person on earth other than Luke Kirby, the actor of movies such as Percy and No Man of God, for the role of Lenny Bruce.</p><p>While Luke Kirby’s professional life needs no introduction, his personal life is still relatively less talked about. In this article, we will talk about everything that you wanted to know about Luke Kirby’s love life, from his first wife to his current girlfriend. Also, you will get some information on Luke’s age, net worth, and Instagram.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Luke Kirby Former Wife, Allison Elliott?</strong></h3><p>Mania Days actor was married to his former wife, Alison Elliott, also an actor, until the end of 2012. The couple reportedly exchanged wedding vows on October 27, 2012, however, their relationship shortly fell apart after that. We have no idea about when they met each other or started dating though.</p><p>Alison Elliott, who is 12 years older than Luke Kirby, debuted in the film industry as the daughter of&nbsp;<a href=#>Alfre Woodard</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Charles S. Dutton</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=#>Pretty Hattie’s Baby</a> (1991). Born in San Francisco, California, and raised in Tokyo, Alison’s other acting credits include 20th Century Women, Lean on Pete, Law, and Order, Terriers, The Buccaneers, Black Tie Affair, Living Dolls, among others.</p><h3><strong>Is Luke Kirby Married Today?</strong></h3><p>Shortly after his marriage with Allison fell apart, a strong rumor occurred that Luke was dating actress Katie Holmes, an ex-wife of actor Tom Cruise.</p><p>Luke and Katie first met on the set of Paul Dalio’s film Mania Days. In May 2013, the pair were first spotted together in New York City walking together. While the representatives for both stars did not respond immediately about the rumors, a source close to ABCNews.com told, “They’re starring in a movie together, they’re having a wonderful time working together and they are just friends.”</p><p>While the rumors of Luke and Katie dating were still strong, Katie told to Allure Magazine in March 2013 that there was no man in her life at the time. However, she indicated a possibility of expanding her family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Luke-Kirby2-253x300.jpg><p>At the time, Katie was still dealing with the aftermath of her divorce with Top Gun actor. The mother of Suri Cruise has been linked or engaged to many other people throughout her life. Circa 2004, she was engaged to actor Chris Klein, popular for his roles in American Pie movies. Calling off her engagement to Chris, she began dating Tom Cruise in 2005, announced the engagement in June 2005, welcomed their daughter in April 2006, and got married in Italy later that year. Unfortunately, Batman Begins actress filed for divorce in 2012.</p><p>Finalizing her divorce from Tom in August 2012, Katie sparked dating rumors with actor Jamie Foxx a year later. Although the pair never made any comment on their dating rumors and mostly hid their romance from the public, sources reported that they parted ways in 2019. The Jack and Jill actress then dated Emilio Vitolo Jr. until May 2021.</p><h3><strong>Is Luke Kirby Still Dating Andrea Sarubbi?</strong></h3><p>One thing we did not tell you earlier was that Luke Kirby was dating a fashion designer Andrea Sarrubi before he met Katie Holmes on the set of Mania Days.</p><p>Initially, the romance rumors–as a result of on-set sparks–between Luke and Katie were brushed off saying Luke was in a relationship with Andreea. However, when DailyMail reported that Luke Kirby had split from his costume designer girlfriend and even had moved out of the home they shared, it was almost clear Luke and Katie had a thing.</p><p>That same year, Andrea talked to DailyMail and said, “Things could be going better,” talking about their relationship. After Luke and Andrea’s split, the magazine reported that the Empire of Dirt actor and Dawson’s Creek talked with each other every day.</p><p>“Luke is currently trying to figure out his relationship issues with Andrea. I don’t think he knows what to do. Katie’s trying to be a friend to him, as she would to anyone, but the more time they spend together, the more she seems to be falling for him, ” a source close to DailyMail said.</p><p>However, as things later surfaced, we got to know that Luke never got over Andrea. All the time he was talking with Katie, he, in his mind, was still thinking about Andrea.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/plugins/trx_addons/components/lazy-load/images/placeholder.png><p>Somehow, the lovely duo managed to settle their differences in their relationship and again got together. As of 2021, Luke and Andrea were still dating each other. They even attended the ‘No Man Of God’ premiere during the 2021 Tribeca Festival on June 11, 2021, in New York City.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Much Is Luke Kirby Net Worth?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>As of March 2021, Luke Kirby’s net worth was reported to be above $2 million.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Luke Kirby Italian?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Although Luke Kirby played a heartbroken Italian in the charming romantic comedy Mambo Italiano, he is not Italian.
