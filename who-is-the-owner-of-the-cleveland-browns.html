As with any professional sports team, ownership plays a crucial role in shaping the direction and success of the organization. In this article, we will delve into the ownership history of the Cleveland Browns, highlighting the key individuals who have held the reins of this beloved football team.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Paul Brown Era (1946-1961)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Cleveland Browns were founded in 1946 by legendary coach Paul Brown. Brown not only served as the team's founder but also as its first head coach. He was known for his innovative coaching techniques and played a significant role in revolutionizing the game of football. Under Brown's leadership, the Browns achieved remarkable success, winning seven league championships in 10 years. However, in 1961, Brown was fired as the team's head coach by Art Modell, who had recently become a partial owner of the franchise.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Art Modell Era (1961-1995)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Art Modell, a successful businessman, took over as the majority owner of the Cleveland Browns in 1961 after purchasing shares from the team's original owners. Modell's tenure as owner was marked by both triumphs and controversies. The Browns continued to be a competitive team under Modell's ownership, making it to the playoffs multiple times. However, the franchise was also plagued by financial difficulties, leading Modell to make some unpopular decisions.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>One of the most controversial moves by Modell was the decision to relocate the team to Baltimore in 1995. This move was met with widespread anger and disappointment from the loyal Cleveland fanbase, who felt betrayed by the owner. The team was renamed the Baltimore Ravens, and Modell became the team's owner until he sold the franchise in 2004.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>The Lerner Family Ownership (1998-2012)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>After the Browns' relocation, the city of Cleveland was left without a professional football team. However, in 1998, the NFL awarded Cleveland an expansion franchise, and the team was reborn as the "new" Cleveland Browns. The team was purchased by Al Lerner, a successful businessman and philanthropist.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Al Lerner's ownership was short-lived, as he passed away in 2002. Following his death, his son, Randy Lerner, took over as the team's owner. During the Lerner family's ownership, the Browns struggled to find success on the field, with only a few playoff appearances. However, they remained committed to the city of Cleveland and its passionate fanbase.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 2012, Randy Lerner sold the Cleveland Browns to Jimmy Haslam, a businessman and philanthropist. The sale marked the end of the Lerner family's ownership and the beginning of a new era for the franchise.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Jimmy Haslam Era (2012-present)</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>Jimmy Haslam, the current owner of the Cleveland Browns, purchased the franchise from Randy Lerner in 2012. Haslam, along with his wife Dee Haslam, has been actively involved in the team's operations and has made significant changes to the organization.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Under Haslam's ownership, the Browns have gone through numerous coaching and front office changes in an effort to turn around the team's fortunes. While the Browns have experienced some ups and downs during Haslam's tenure, the team has shown promising signs of improvement in recent years.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Haslam has made a concerted effort to connect with the fans and engage with the Cleveland community. He has invested in stadium renovations, improved fan experiences, and supported various charitable initiatives. Haslam's commitment to the team and the city has endeared him to many Browns fans.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The ownership history of the Cleveland Browns is a tale of triumphs, controversies, and the enduring love of a passionate fanbase. From the legendary Paul Brown to the controversial Art Modell, the Browns have seen their fair share of ownership changes. The Lerner family's ownership brought hope and dedication, while Jimmy Haslam's era has ushered in a new era of optimism.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>As the current owner, Haslam has made significant strides in rebuilding the franchise and establishing a strong connection with the fans. With ongoing improvements and a dedicated ownership group, Browns fans can look forward to a brighter future for their beloved team.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn6hlmah6tbTEZqawppWnerCyjK2fnmWTobK3scuapZ1lkqe8uLrS</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-the-owner-of-the-cleveland-browns.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-the-owner-of-the-cleveland-browns.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-the-owner-of-the-cleveland-browns.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-the-owner-of-the-cleveland-browns.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-the-owner-of-the-cleveland-browns.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-the-owner-of-the-cleveland-browns.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./elizabeth-smart-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./elizabeth-smart-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Elizabeth Smart Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./vicente-fern-ndez-jr.html>Vicente Fernndez Jr.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./vicente-fern-ndez-jr.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
