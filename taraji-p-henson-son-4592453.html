Henson</strong></a> did not let National Sons Day pass this year without paying homage to her son, <strong>Marcell Johnson</strong>. The Hollywood star, 51, welcomed her son, 27, with the late <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>William LaMarr “Mark” Johnson</strong></a>, her high school sweetheart who was murdered at the age of 34 in 2003. In an Instagram post on National Sons Day in September, Taraji celebrated Marcell, calling him her “heart.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“Happy #nationalsonday,” she captioned a series of photos of the duo. “my heart my love my baby forever!!!” So, who is the Empire star’s son? Below are five things about Marcell.</p><h2><strong>Marcell is Taraji’s only son</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Marcell, born on May 10, 1994 to Taraji and her high school sweetheart William, is the actress’ only son. In an interview with PEOPLE’s <strong>Jess Cagle</strong> on The Jess Cagle Interview in 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Taraji expressed the fears</a> she has as a Black mother to a Black son amidst the onslaught of police killings. “He has a really good heart. It’s just hard to know that the world can pick him out and turn him into a monster at any given moment,” she said. “That’s what I fear, that’s something that I carry — I think every Black mother does. All parents worry about their kids, but then when you see the news and you see people getting off for killing innocent children with no weapon it’s like, that doesn’t exempt my son.”</p><h2><strong>Marcell’s father passed away when he was a child</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Taraji-P-Henson-Marcell-Johnson-ss-post-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>The details surrounding the death of Marcell’s father William are horrific: he was stabbed to death at the age of 34, when Marcell was only 9 years old. In an episode of her Facebook Watch series “Peace of Mind with Taraji” in January, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Taraji recalled being unable to break the news</a> to her son, telling him instead that he died in an accident. Marcell later learned the truth. “My son’s father was suddenly taken — murdered — when he was 9, and I didn’t know how to tell him that. I couldn’t tell him he was murdered, so I told him he died in an accident,” she said. “Later on in life he found out and he came back to me and was like, ‘Why didn’t you tell me my daddy was murdered?’ And so then we had to get therapy. . . It was the worst way you could die, and I just didn’t have the words. I didn’t know how to tell a 9-year-old.”</p><h2><strong>Marcell follows in his mother’s footsteps as an actor</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>The apple does not fall too far from the tree, as Marcell also has a career in Hollywood, both in front of the screen and behind the scenes. Marcell has worked behind the scenes for the film Little with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Issa Rae</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Marsai Martin</strong></a>, and has made appearances in films Misled, Needlestick, A Girl Like Her, and the TV series Detroiters.</p><h2><strong>Marcell has starred opposite his mother on the small screen</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Taraji-P-Henson-Marcell-Johnson-ss-post1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Most recently, Marcell’s TV credits have included a familiar title: the acclaimed Fox drama series Empire, wherein his famous mother stars as Cookie Lyon. The actor has appeared in 16 episodes as a character named Marcel, sharing the small screen with his formidable mother.</p><h2><strong>Marcell attended Howard University</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Taraji previously told Uptown magazine in 2015 that her son would be transferring to her alma mater, Howard University. The admission came after she said that <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Marcell was racially profiled by campus</a> police at the University of Southern California. “I’m not paying $50K so I can’t sleep at night wondering is this the night my son is getting racially profiled on campus,” Taraji said. USC released a statement shortly after, with campus public safety director <strong>John Thomas </strong>stating that an investigation was underway. The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>actress later apologized for her comments</a>, writing on social media, “A mother’s job is not easy and neither is a police officer’s. Sometimes as humans we overreact without gathering all of the facts. As a mother in this case I overreacted and for that I apologize.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OaqZqimWK9brTEp6qopl2ovK95k25wa2xlaHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaraji-p-henson-son-4592453.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftaraji-p-henson-son-4592453.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftaraji-p-henson-son-4592453.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftaraji-p-henson-son-4592453.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaraji-p-henson-son-4592453.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaraji-p-henson-son-4592453.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./thomas-moretti-obituary-news-elmira-new-york-man-and-owner-of-morettis-restaurant-thomas-moretti-passes-away.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./thomas-moretti-obituary-news-elmira-new-york-man-and-owner-of-morettis-restaurant-thomas-moretti-passes-away.html>Thomas Moretti Obituary News: Elmira, New York Man and Owner of Morettis Restaurant, Thomas Moret</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./missing-pedro-da-silva-2023-update-has-the-3-year-old-boy-been-found-yet-kidnapping-case.html>Has the 3-year-old boy been found yet?
