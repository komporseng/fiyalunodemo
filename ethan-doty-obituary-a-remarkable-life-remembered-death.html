Ethan’s untimely departure has left a void that will be deeply felt by his friends, family, and all who had the privilege of knowing him. Ethan Sulik-Doty was a young man with extraordinary potential, an unquenchable curiosity, and an infectious passion for engineering. His journey began in the hallowed halls of the Kate Gleason College of Engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). From the very start, Ethan’s academic prowess was apparent, and he soon became a prominent figure in the college.</p><p>Born on March 10, 2001, Ethan was a native of Rochester, New York, and he began his educational journey at RIT in 2019, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. Throughout his time at the Kate Gleason College of Engineering, Ethan exhibited a remarkable commitment to his studies. His professors describe him as a diligent and focused student, always eager to learn and excel in his coursework. However, Ethan’s contributions extended well beyond his academic achievements. He was actively involved in various student organizations, demonstrating his dedication to making a positive impact on campus. His involvement in engineering clubs and organizations allowed him to explore his passion for robotics and automation. He was known for his leadership qualities and the ability to inspire his peers to work diligently towards their goals.</p><p>Ethan’s enthusiasm for engineering was infectious, and he shared his knowledge and passion with fellow students as a mentor, helping them navigate the challenging world of engineering with patience and kindness. His impact on the Kate Gleason College of Engineering extended far beyond his own coursework, as he played an instrumental role in fostering a sense of community and support among his peers. In addition to his academic and extracurricular achievements, Ethan was an ardent advocate for sustainability and environmental responsibility. His projects and research reflected a deep commitment to finding innovative engineering solutions to address pressing global challenges, particularly in the realm of clean energy and resource conservation.</p><p>Ethan Sulik-Doty’s untimely passing has left a void not only in the Kate Gleason College of Engineering but also in the hearts of those who knew him. His potential as a budding engineer was limitless, and his compassionate nature endeared him to all who had the privilege of crossing his path. As we remember Ethan, we are reminded of the importance of nurturing young talents and providing support to the future engineers, innovators, and leaders who will shape our world. His legacy will continue to inspire future generations of students at RIT, encouraging them to pursue their passions with the same dedication and enthusiasm that defined Ethan’s life. Ethan is survived by his family and friends, who will continue to cherish the memories of his extraordinary journey and the indelible mark he left on the Kate Gleason College of Engineering and the RIT community. While Ethan’s time with us was too short, his impact will be felt for years to come, as his spirit lives on in the hearts of those who knew and loved him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwsdOhmKdllKTBunnOm6CtrZGnxm6tjKucppmioK6juMRmo6KelWK%2FprnEppmeqpWZeqWxwK2faA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fethan-doty-obituary-a-remarkable-life-remembered-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fethan-doty-obituary-a-remarkable-life-remembered-death.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fethan-doty-obituary-a-remarkable-life-remembered-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fethan-doty-obituary-a-remarkable-life-remembered-death.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fethan-doty-obituary-a-remarkable-life-remembered-death.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fethan-doty-obituary-a-remarkable-life-remembered-death.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./wanderlei-silva.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./wanderlei-silva.html>Wanderlei Silva</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./one-shot.html>ONE SHOT | Ferran Lyrics, Meaning &amp;amp; Videos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./one-shot.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
