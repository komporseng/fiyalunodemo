Kim revealed that the space would be rented out for travel. She revealed about their marriage that it resembled a business partnership and added that she was adamant about the divorce and didn’t want to patch things up.</p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theancestory.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Welcome-to-Plathville-Episode-10-574x450.png decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43311 alt="Welcome to Plathville Episode 10" width=574 height=450 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-43311 class=wp-caption-text>Welcome to Plathville Episode 10</p><h2>Kim tells Barry why she wants to proceed with the divorce in&nbsp;Welcome to Plathville&nbsp;Season 4, Episode 10</h2><p>In Welcome to Plathville Season 4, Episode 10, Kim explains to Barry why she intends to move forward with the divorce.</p><p>Kim admitted during her confessional that she was in a position where she didn’t want to work on her marriage.

He didn’t actually value her, she continued. The star of Welcome to Plathville added that she didn’t want to save their marriage.</p><p>Barry expressed surprise at Kim’s admission and claimed that she had been duped into believing a lie.
