<time>05 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Meet Josefa Salinas, the former wife of late rapper Coolio. On 28 September 2022, Coolio was found dead when he was visiting a friend on Wednesday afternoon when he passed away. An official cause of his death hasn’t been revealed by the officials. His manager, Jarel Posey, confirmed the sad news to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a> by saying: “We are saddened by the loss of our dear friend and client, Coolio, who passed away this afternoon. He touched the world with the gift of his talent and will be missed profoundly.”</p><p>So who is his ex-wife? Learn about her in this article elow.</p><h3><strong>Meet Josefa Salinas, Late Rapper Coolio Wife</strong></h3><p>Late rapper Coolio met his ex-wife Josefa Salinas in 1987. The couple clocked in and started dating sometime after that. After 10 years of being in a relationship, they tied the knots on 18 May 1996. However, the marriage reportedly lasted for only four years. Eventually, they got divorced.</p><p>However, that didn’t end their relationship as they shared four children together; three daughters, named, Artisha, Brandi, Jackie, and a son named Artis. In 2008, he made a headline after laying down a ground rule for dating his daughters who at the time were Artisha (20), Brandi (19), and Jackie (15).</p><p>With that philosophy, the rapper — who would be willing to “do the rest of my life in prison if you mess with my kids” — warns any young man to not have any expectations from his daughters. “I tell them don’t come around here trying to get nothing you ain’t getting at home. First of all, you ain’t going to get it,” says Coolio. However, the doting dad tries not to be too intimidating and will “get my pit bull and we walk around the block” while his daughters are spending time with their friends, but that doesn’t mean that he doesn’t keep his girls on their toes!</p><p>The late rapper said, “I don’t sit there and watch over them, but the other day, I walked in the living room, and Artisha was sitting on some dude’s lap, I was like, ‘Oh, hell no.’ She just sat there, so I picked up one of the legs from the pool table and said, ‘You better get up right now.’ She was like, ‘I’m 20 years old!’ I was like you better get yourself a 20-year-old house then!”</p><p>He bore six other children from different relationships. They were Grtis Ivey, Milan Ivey, Darius Ivey, Zhaneand Ivey, Kate Ivey, and Shayne Ivey.</p><p>Josefa recently posted about her husband in July 2022. She posted, “It’s OFFICIAL !!!!! Congratulations to @coolio! Gangsta Paradise hit ONE BILLION views!!!! Only 200 songs out of 80 million on @youtube are in this club! Welcome home where you belong @coolio Well deserved!&nbsp; #thingsjosefaknows&nbsp; #onebillionclub2022 #westside #gangstaparadise #jobwelldone.”</p><p>The Gangsta’s Paradise rapper may have also shared a child with ex-girlfriend Anabella Chatman. In 2010, former love interest Anabella took legal action in an attempt to get Coolio to pay child support according to TMZ. The outlet reported that she was more interested in child support than money, however.</p><p>She told TMZ that in order to demonstrate to the state of California that she had investigated and used all available avenues in order to be eligible for Medi-Cal, she had to petition for child support. The Aw, Here It Goes! the rapper was ordered to pay $300 in child support for Christopher Kal El Ivey Bellesi, who was still an infant, at the time by a Los Angeles child support agency.</p><p>According to documents that were filed, Coolio’s monthly salary at the time was only $1,387. The Grammy Award winner encountered additional legal difficulties with Anabella three years after the incident.</p><p>According to TMZ, authorities detained Coolio detained in 2013 after allegedly pushing and punching his baby mama to the ground. According to a police record obtained by the publication, the well-known hip-hop artist fled the scene after the altercation, carrying his young boy and another woman, Melynda Karr, who was also there.</p><p>Anabella claimed that he attempted to flee and hit her with his automobile. When the police got on the scene, they saw tire tracks on her leg.</p><p>She had a broken lip, and a gushing middle right finger. The New York Daily News reported that she “soaked in blood”. According to TMZ, the musician claimed that he was the victim of the incident and that Anabella attacked him out of jealousy. Despite their skepticism, the police nonetheless detained Coolio. They charged him with a misdemeanor count of battery resulting in domestic violence days after the event.</p><p>However, Josefa also had a daughter before he met Coolio. She goes by the name Parees Salinas (age 41), Peezie (<a href=#>@peezie</a>). She also has a son named <a href=#>Melan Santana Salinas-Ivey</a> who turned 26 years old in April 2022.</p><h3><strong>Josefa Salinas Husband Now</strong></h3><p>Based on her social media post, Josefa Salina is currently single.</p><p>At the time of his death, Coolio was in a relationship with Mimi Ivey. The&nbsp;<a href=#>pair’s relationship</a> was featured in an episode of Celebrity Wife Swap.</p><p>First aired on March 5, 2013, the couple swapped places with Sugar Ray frontman,&nbsp;<a href=#>Mark McGrath</a>, and his wife, Carin Kingsland. Mimi reflected on her experience in the show to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Women in Business</a>: “Although I loved Coolio with all my heart I was not happy with the state of our relationship at that time. We’ve had our challenges over the last couple of years just like any other relationship. We have eleven kids between the two of us, two grandkids, and two more on the way that keeps our home life exciting.</p><p>Mimi added, “But on the other hand, we definitely work well together because we are able to separate business from our home life by always supporting each other professionally. I’ve always had my own light in the entertainment world, and this is why we are able to launch a collaborative venture together.”</p><p>Later, they appeared on the couple counseling show Love Goals in 2020. They reportedly share two children; a daughter Majaniek and a son.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is Josefa Salinas?</strong></h3><p>Born in 1958, Josefa Salinas is 63 years.</p><h3><strong>Josefa Salinas Young</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Josefa-Salinas-Young-300x290.jpg><h3><strong>Josefa Salinas Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Josefa Salinas has a net worth above $600 thousand.
