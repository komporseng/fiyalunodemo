<time>13 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>While Eminem has found unprecedented success as a rap artist, his personal life has always been a source of constant trouble. Raised by a single mother, Eminem faced his fair share of hardships during his early years. While he went on to achieve massive success in the music industry, his personal life stayed the same. Eminem was married to Kim Mathers, who had an upbringing similar to Eminem, if not worse. The pair married but had a rocky relationship, which led to a divorce. In this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Kim Mathers.</p><p><strong>Kim Mathers, also known as Kim Scott, is an American author and illustrator of children’s books. She is best known as the ex-wife of rapper Eminem.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Eminem-ex-wife-Kim-Mathers.jpg><h2>Early Life:</h2><p>Kimberly Anne Scott was born on the 9th of January, 1975, to Casimer Sluck and Kathleen Sluck. Kimberly faced abuse from a young age as her father, who was an alcoholic, would often beat her and her younger sister, Dawn. As a result, Kimberly’s parents divorced and her mother got married to another man. But to Kimberly’s dismay, her stepfather was just as worse as her father. Around the same time, Kimberly was studying at Lincoln High School alongside her sister. She met Eminem during her time in high school, who went by the name of Marshal Bruce Mathers III.</p><h2>Moving in with Eminem:</h2><p>Kim and Eminem first met in 1988 at a house party in Detroit, when Eminem was rapping LL Cool J’s I’m Bad, shitless while standing on the table. The pair got acquainted soon after and when things got bad with her stepfather, Kim and Dawn decided to move in with Eminem and his mother. Kim and Eminem graduated high school, and Kim got pregnant in 1995. She gave birth to Hailie Mathers on December 25, 1995.</p><h2>Down the rabbit hole:</h2><p>Kim Mathers and Eminem’s relationship has been a roller-coaster of love, hate, marriage, divorce, and drama.

Kim and Eminem got married for the first time in 1999, the same year Eminem released his breakthrough album The Slim Shady LP. The album contained songs that depicted Kim in a negative and violent way, such as “97 Bonnie & Clyde.” &nbsp;At a later date, Kim was seen kissing the nightclub bouncer, John Guerrera. Raged by antics, Eminem attacked Gurrera and was charged with assault and possession of a concealed weapon. Eminem received probation of two years and later released his hit single, Kim.</p><h2>Suicide Attempts:</h2><p>On the 7th of July 2000, Kim and Dawn attended one of Eminem’s concerts for the Up in Smoke Tour. Before the concert, Kim mentioned that Eminem had promised her he would not play the song, Kim. But contrary to his supposed promise, Eminem played the song and even abused a blow-up doll meant to represent Kim.</p><p>Following this incident, Kim left the concert and was involved in a car accident. When she was taken back to their home in Detroit, Kim sliced her wrists in an attempt to take her own life. Following the suicide attempt, Eminem filed for Divorce and Kim sued him for defamation.

The reconciliation lasted for a total of 1 year and the pair got divorced on October 11, 2001. &nbsp;They had a bitter custody battle over Hailie.
