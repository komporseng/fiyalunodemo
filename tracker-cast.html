CBS’ <a href=#>Tracker cast</a> is filled with familiar faces, and we’re not just talking about The Young and the Restless alum Justin Hartley.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Tracker is CBS’ action drama</a> series following Colter Shaw, a “lone-wolf survivalist” who travels the United States as a “reward seeker,” who helps people and law enforcement solve a variety of mysteries through his expert tracking skills. The series, which premiered on February 11, 2024 after the Super Bowl LIX, is based on Jeffrey Deaver’s book series, <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Never Game</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Justin Hartley, who both stars as Colter and is also an executive producer on Tracker told <a href=# rel=nofollow>TV Insider</a> in January 2024 about how his character is different and similar to his notable role as Kevin Pearson in NBC’s This Is Us.&nbsp;</p><p>“I carry Kevin with me a little bit into this role,” he said. “This is an action thriller and Colter’s circumstances are completely different. You’ve got the father and the question about what happened there. You’ve got family drama, you’ve got questions that there are no answers to. I think if you put Kevin in Colter’s boots, he would be dead in a day. But that doesn’t mean they don’t have the same heart.”</p><p>He also noted the differences between the flashbacks in Tracker and This Is Us. “The flashbacks in the pilot are necessary to tell a quick story, like, ‘This is where this guy is,'” he said. “We’ll get away from them a little bit more as the series goes on.”</p><p>But of course, Hartley, who soaps fans will remember as Fox Crane in Passions and <a href=#>Adam Newman in The Young and the Restless</a>, isn’t the only familiar face in Tracker.

Colter is described as a “lone-wolf survivalist” who roams the country as a “reward seeker,” in which he uses his expert tracking skills to help the police and regular people solve mysteries. The character, who also comes from a fractured family, was first introduced in Jeffrey Deaver’s bestselling book, <a href=#>The Never Game</a>, which Tracker is based on. Colter’s hometown is Orlando Park and he was born on January 29, according to Tracker‘s official website.</p><p>Hartley previously starred as Adam Newman on The Young and the Restless from 2014 to 2016. The role earned him a Daytime Emmy Awaard nomination in 2016 in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series category. He also starred as Fox Crane on the soap opera Passions from 2002 to 2006, as well as Oliver Queen, also known as the Green Arrow, The CW’s Smallville from 2006 to 2011. His most recent notable TV role was as Kevin Pearson in This Is Us from 2016 to 2022. The role earned him three Critics’ Choice Television Award nominations in the Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series category.</p><p>In his inteview with TV Insider, Hartley teased Colter’s journey throughout Tracker. “He’s searching for the answer to that question. He’s a restless guy, and we’ll unpeel it throughout the season, what his childhood was,” he said. “We’ll get into more detail about the relationship with his mother, his father, his brother, all that stuff.”</p><p>He also addressed whether he felt any “pressure” about Tracker premiering after the Super Bowl. “The more times people say, ‘Is there pressure?’ the more I feel like maybe I should start feeling pressure,” he said. “But it was the same thing with the This Is Us pilot. I knew it was very, very good and something I would remember for the rest of my life. That’s how I feel about this. I know our show is great, and that’s all you can do.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.5><h2>Fiona Rene (Reenie Green)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Colton-Shaw-Tracker.jpg><p>Fire Country alum Fiona Rene stars as Reenie Green in Tracker.

Bobby is a tech genius who provides Colter with a lead toward a local burger joint in the pilot of Tracker.</p><p>Like Bobby, Graise is also a double amputee. In an interview with Today in 2018, Graise, whose legs were amputed as a child due to missing fibula bones, opened up about what it was like to star in his first major movie at the tie, Step Up: High Water. “When you look out into the world and don’t see people who reflect your life and your abilities, it’s tough,” he said “You don’t see us reflected in Hollywood.”</p><p>He also told Today at the time that he doesn’t like being called an inspiration. “Honestly, I struggle with that,” he said. “I am not the only disabled person doing this. I am not the only one out there. But when they say things like ‘I am inspiring,’ I try to steer away from that.”</p><p>He continued, “Because what they are usually really saying is, ‘If you can do that, then I have no excuse.’ It is more about them, not me. And it diminishes all of my hard work. You can do anything if you work hard. I really worked hard to get here. It’s not about my disability.”</p><p>Graise previously starred on TV shows like Locke & Key, Queer as Folk, Dynasty, and The Walking Dead.&nbsp;He has also appeared in movies like The Tomorrow War.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=12.410772225827><h2>Melissa Roxburgh (Dory Shaw)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Bob-Exley-Tracker.jpg><p>Manifest alum Melissa Roxburgh is joining the cast as Colter’s little sister Dory.

But, after consulting with his sister Dr. Dory Shaw (Melissa Roxburgh)— a professor at the school — Colter discovers a trail of explicit photos and messages that lead him to uncover a dangerous (and deadly) conspiracy on campus.”</p><p>Dory has been seen in flashbacks from Colter’s childhood, but there has not been any mention of her as an adult.
